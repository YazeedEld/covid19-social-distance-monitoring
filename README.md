# COVID-19 Social Distance Monitoring System
A social distancing monitoring system developed in MATLAB. Pedestrians from a surveillance camera video footage are detected, tracked, and checked whether they are maintaining a sufficient social distance between others. Using an adaptive background modeling technique, the people in the footage are marked as foreground. Their locations are then mapped to a birdâ€™s eye view of the scene and distances between them get calculated.
